Woolly Plectranthus (Coleus barbatus), also known as Brazilian boldo, is a tropical perennial shrub belonging to the Lamiaceae family. Native to the Paleotropical region, its natural distribution extends from tropical Africa through the Arabian Peninsula to India. The plant typically reaches heights of 1 to 2 meters, forming a rounded shrub. Its leaves are velvety, simple, opposite, and ovate with serrated margins, measuring between 5 to 8 centimeters in length. The plant produces blue to purple flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences that can reach up to 25 centimeters in length.

In traditional medicine, Woolly Plectranthus is utilized for its digestive and hepatoprotective properties. It is commonly used as a remedy for gastrointestinal issues, acting as a digestive aid and mild sedative. The plant contains forskolin, a labdane diterpene that has garnered scientific interest due to its potential therapeutic applications, including the activation of adenylate cyclase, leading to increased levels of cyclic AMP in cells. This compound has been studied for its potential benefits in treating conditions such as hypertension, glaucoma, and certain cardiovascular disorders.

Beyond its medicinal uses, Woolly Plectranthus is also cultivated as an ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions, valued for its attractive foliage and flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and can tolerate a range of light conditions, from full sun to partial shade. Its resilience and aesthetic appeal make it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.

It's important to note that while Woolly Plectranthus is commonly referred to as boldo in Brazil, it differs from the true boldo (Peumus boldus), which is native to Chile. Despite sharing a common name and some similar uses, these plants belong to different families and have distinct chemical compositions. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using them interchangeably, as their effects and potential side effects may vary.

In summary, Woolly Plectranthus is a versatile plant with significant cultural, medicinal, and ornamental value. Its broad range of applications, from traditional remedies to garden aesthetics, underscores its importance in various regions around the world.
