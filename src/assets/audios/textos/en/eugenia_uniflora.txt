Eugenia uniflora, commonly known as Surinam cherry, Brazilian cherry, or pitanga, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree belonging to the Myrtaceae family. Native to the eastern coast of South America, spanning from Suriname and French Guiana to southern Brazil, as well as parts of Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina, it has been widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions around the world.

The plant typically reaches heights of 2 to 7 meters (6.5 to 23 feet) and features a dense, bushy canopy. Its leaves are glossy, ovate, and measure between 2 and 6 centimeters (0.8 to 2.4 inches) in length. New foliage often emerges with a reddish hue, maturing to a deep green. The leaves are arranged oppositely along the stems and emit a fragrant aroma when crushed.

Flowering occurs in spring and early summer, producing small, fragrant, white flowers with four petals and numerous stamens. These blossoms are attractive to pollinators, including bees and butterflies.

The fruit of E. uniflora is a ribbed, pumpkin-shaped berry, measuring 2 to 4 centimeters (0.8 to 1.6 inches) in diameter. When ripe, the fruit's color ranges from bright red to dark purple, depending on the variety. The flesh is juicy and aromatic, offering a sweet-tart flavor that is both refreshing and distinctive. Each fruit contains one to three large, resinous seeds.

Culinary uses of the Surinam cherry are diverse. The fruit can be consumed fresh, though some individuals may find the flavor resinous or slightly bitter. It is commonly used in the preparation of jams, jellies, sauces, and beverages. In certain cultures, the fruit is fermented to produce alcoholic drinks. Additionally, the leaves have been utilized in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antidiarrheal properties.

E. uniflora is also valued as an ornamental plant. Its attractive foliage, fragrant flowers, and colorful fruits make it suitable for hedges, screens, or standalone specimens in gardens and landscapes. The plant is adaptable to various soil types but prefers well-drained soils and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade.

However, in some regions, particularly in parts of Florida and Hawaii, E. uniflora has become invasive, spreading rapidly and outcompeting native vegetation. This characteristic necessitates careful management and monitoring when introducing the plant to non-native areas.

Despite its invasiveness in certain locales, the Surinam cherry remains a popular choice for gardeners and landscapers due to its aesthetic appeal and edible fruits. Its resilience and adaptability continue to contribute to its widespread cultivation across suitable climates.
