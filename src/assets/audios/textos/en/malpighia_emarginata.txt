Malpighia emarginata, commonly known as acerola, Barbados cherry, West Indian cherry, or wild crepe myrtle, is a tropical fruit-bearing shrub or small tree in the family Malpighiaceae. Native to South America, southern Mexico, and Central America, it is now also cultivated in subtropical areas throughout the world, including the Caribbean and parts of Asia. The plant is renowned for its bright red, cherry-like fruits that are exceptionally rich in vitamin C, as well as other nutrients.

**Description**

Acerola typically grows between 2 and 3 meters in height but can reach up to 6 meters under favorable conditions. It has a short trunk with a dense, rounded canopy composed of slender, spreading branches. The leaves are evergreen, simple, ovate to elliptic, measuring 2 to 8 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. They are arranged oppositely along the stems.

The plant produces small, pink to white, funnel-shaped flowers, about 1 to 2 centimeters in diameter, with five petals and numerous stamens. These flowers are often found in clusters of two to five and can bloom several times a year, especially after rainfall.

The fruit is a bright red or sometimes yellowish drupe, resembling a cherry, measuring 1 to 3 centimeters in diameter. It has a thin skin and juicy, tender pulp divided into three lobes, each containing a small seed. The flavor ranges from sweet to tart, depending on the variety and ripeness.

Acerola thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring temperatures between 25°C and 30°C. It grows best in well-drained, sandy loam soils with a slightly acidic to neutral pH but is adaptable to various soil types, provided they are not waterlogged. The plant is drought-tolerant once established but produces better yields with regular watering. It requires full sun exposure for optimal fruiting but can tolerate partial shade.

Propagation is commonly done through seeds, cuttings, or air layering. Seed-grown plants may exhibit variability in fruit quality, so vegetative propagation methods are preferred to maintain desirable traits. Acerola plants typically begin to bear fruit within one to two years of planting, with multiple harvests possible each year due to their recurrent flowering cycles.

The acerola fruit is highly valued for its exceptional vitamin C content, which can range from 1,000 to 4,500 milligrams per 100 grams of fresh fruit, making it one of the richest known natural sources of this essential nutrient. In addition to vitamin C, acerola provides vitamins A and B, flavonoids, and minerals such as iron, calcium, and phosphorus.

Due to its high nutritional value, acerola is consumed fresh and processed into various products, including juices, jams, jellies, ice creams, and dietary supplements. Its juice is often blended with other fruit juices to enhance nutritional content and flavor. The fruit's antioxidant properties have also garnered interest for potential health benefits, including boosting the immune system and combating oxidative stress.

Beyond its nutritional and culinary uses, acerola is also grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage, flowers, and fruits. Its ability to tolerate pruning makes it suitable for hedges and bonsai cultivation. Additionally, the plant's flowers are known to attract pollinators such as bees, contributing to local biodiversity.

In traditional medicine, various parts of the acerola plant have been used to treat ailments like diarrhea, liver disorders, and fever, although scientific evidence supporting these uses is limited.

Overall, Malpighia emarginata is a versatile plant that offers both nutritional and aesthetic benefits, making it a valuable addition to gardens and orchards in suitable climates.
