The dwarf umbrella tree (Heptapleurum arboricola), formerly known as Schefflera arboricola, is an evergreen shrub native to Taiwan and Hainan Province, China. It typically grows between 3 to 6 meters in height, either as a free-standing plant, a climber, or as an epiphyte on other trees. The plant is characterized by its glossy, palmate compound leaves, each consisting of 7 to 9 leaflets. These leaflets measure between 9 to 20 cm in length and 4 to 10 cm in width, featuring a wedge-shaped base, entire margins, and an obtuse or acute apex. The upper surface of the leaves is shiny and glabrous, while the underside is lighter and matte in texture.

Flowering occurs from July to October, with the plant producing inflorescences in the form of 20 cm panicles composed of small umbels. Each umbel measures 7 to 10 mm in diameter and contains 5 to 10 hermaphroditic flowers, which range in color from yellow to green. The flowers exhibit radial symmetry and possess a double perianth structure. Following pollination, the plant produces fruits that are initially gland-dotted and transition in color from orange to red-violet as they mature. These fruits are small, approximately 5 mm in diameter, and contain multiple seeds that are dispersed by birds.

In cultivation, Heptapleurum arboricola is popular as both an indoor and outdoor ornamental plant, valued for its adaptability and attractive foliage. Numerous cultivars have been developed, some featuring variegated leaves with creamy white to yellow patterns, and others exhibiting dwarf forms. The cultivar 'Gold Capella' has been recognized with the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. The plant is also suitable for bonsai cultivation, making it a versatile choice for various horticultural applications.

When caring for the dwarf umbrella tree, it prefers higher light conditions but can adapt to a wide range of light levels. As a tropical plant, it appreciates humidity; however, it is important to avoid waterlogging. Keeping the soil moist but not wet is ideal for its growth. Additionally, it is crucial to note that Heptapleurum arboricola contains insoluble calcium oxalate crystals, which are toxic if ingested. These sharp crystals can cause irritation and swelling in the tissues of the mouth and digestive tract, potentially leading to serious health issues. Therefore, it is advisable to keep this plant out of reach of children and pets to prevent accidental ingestion.
