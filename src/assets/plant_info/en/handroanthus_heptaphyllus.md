_Handroanthus heptaphyllus_, commonly known as the pink trumpet tree or pink tabebuia, is a deciduous tree belonging to the Bignoniaceae family. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, it thrives in areas such as the Paran√° River basin, as well as parts of Paraguay, Bolivia, and Argentina. This species is highly regarded for its striking pink blossoms and robust timber.

Typically, the pink trumpet tree reaches heights of 10 to 30 meters, featuring a straight, cylindrical trunk that can measure between 40 to 140 centimeters in diameter. The bark is brownish-gray and becomes deeply fissured as the tree matures. Its crown is sparse and globose, allowing filtered sunlight to pass through.

The leaves are palmately compound, usually comprising five to seven elliptical leaflets, each measuring approximately 10 to 15 centimeters in length, with serrated margins. The tree is semi-deciduous, shedding its leaves briefly during the dry season.

Flowering occurs in the spring, often before new leaves emerge, resulting in a spectacular display of pink to rose-purple, trumpet-shaped flowers. These blossoms are about 5 centimeters wide and are arranged in terminal panicles, making the tree highly ornamental.

Following the flowering period, the tree produces elongated, brown seed pods that can reach up to 30 to 40 centimeters in length and about 1 to 1.5 centimeters in width. These pods contain numerous winged seeds, facilitating wind dispersal.

The wood of _Handroanthus heptaphyllus_ is notably hard and heavy, with a clear distinction between the darker heartwood and lighter sapwood. It is highly resistant to weathering and pests, making it valuable for various applications, including boat construction, docks, truck beds, beams, crosspieces, stairs, floors, and woodturning.

In urban settings, the pink trumpet tree is often planted as a decorative species in parks, squares, and along streets, owing to its attractive floral display and the light shade it provides. Its adaptability to different soil types and resistance to drought further enhance its suitability for landscaping purposes.

Culturally, the pink trumpet tree holds significant importance in Paraguay, where it is recognized as the national tree. Its vibrant blossoms and durable wood have made it a symbol of resilience and beauty in the region.

In summary, _Handroanthus heptaphyllus_ is a visually striking and culturally significant tree, valued for its ornamental appeal and durable timber, making it a popular choice in both natural and urban landscapes.
