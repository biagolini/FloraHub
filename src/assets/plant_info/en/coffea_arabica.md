_Coffea arabica_, commonly known as Arabica coffee, is a species of plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is believed to be the first coffee species to have been cultivated and is the dominant variety, accounting for approximately 60% of global coffee production. Native to Ethiopia and Yemen, the plant has spread to various tropical regions, where it is grown at high altitudes to produce high-quality coffee beans.

The plant is a shrub or small tree that can grow between 2 and 5 meters tall. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and oval-shaped. The flowers are white and emit a sweet fragrance similar to jasmine. The fruits are small drupes, initially green, that turn red or purple when ripe. Each fruit typically contains two seeds, known as coffee beans.

Arabica coffee is prized for its smooth flavor and rich aroma, with floral and fruity notes. Its caffeine content is lower compared to Robusta coffee, making the beverage less bitter and more pleasant to the palate. The Bourbon and Typica varieties are among the most widely cultivated and serve as the foundation for many other cultivars.

The cultivation of _Coffea arabica_ requires a mild tropical climate, with temperatures between 15°C and 24°C and moderate rainfall. The plants thrive in well-drained, organic-rich soils and are often grown in the shade to improve bean quality. Countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Ethiopia, and Costa Rica are among the top producers of Arabica coffee worldwide.

Beyond its economic value, coffee plays a significant social and cultural role. The beverage is consumed globally and is an essential part of daily life for millions of people. Additionally, research suggests that moderate coffee consumption may offer health benefits, such as antioxidant properties and cognitive function improvement.

Despite its importance, _Coffea arabica_ cultivation faces challenges, including climate change, pests, and diseases such as coffee leaf rust. To address these issues, growers invest in sustainable farming techniques and the development of more resistant varieties.

Arabica coffee remains the preferred choice for specialty and high-quality coffees, playing a crucial role in the economy and culture of many coffee-producing nations.
