_Psidium guajava_, commonly known as the guava tree, is a small tropical evergreen tree or shrub belonging to the Myrtaceae family. Native to the Caribbean, Central, and South America, it has been widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. The tree typically reaches heights between 3 to 10 meters, featuring a short trunk with smooth, thin, copper-colored bark that flakes off, revealing greenish layers beneath. Its branches are quadrangular and pubescent when young.

The leaves are simple, opposite, oblong to elliptic, measuring 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with prominent veins and a fragrant aroma when crushed. The flowers are white, about 2.5 centimeters in diameter, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming singly or in small clusters in the leaf axils.

The fruit, known as guava, is a berry that varies in shape from round to ovoid or pear-shaped, measuring 4 to 12 centimeters in diameter. The skin color ranges from green to yellow, sometimes exhibiting a reddish hue. The flesh can be white, pink, red, or salmon-colored, with a sweet or slightly acidic flavor and a strong, characteristic aroma. The fruit contains numerous small, hard seeds embedded in the pulp.

Guava is highly valued for its nutritional content, being rich in vitamins A and C, dietary fiber, and essential minerals like potassium and magnesium. The high vitamin C content, ranging from 180 to 300 milligrams per 100 grams of fruit, surpasses that of many citrus fruits, contributing to immune system support and skin health.

In culinary applications, guava is consumed fresh or processed into various products such as juices, jams, jellies, and desserts. In Brazil, the traditional "goiabada," a dense guava paste, is a popular sweet treat. The fruit's unique flavor profile also makes it suitable for savory dishes and sauces.

Beyond its culinary uses, guava has a long history in traditional medicine. The leaves are used to prepare infusions or teas believed to treat gastrointestinal issues, such as diarrhea and dysentery, due to their antimicrobial properties. The bark and roots have also been utilized for their astringent qualities in treating wounds and ulcers.

Guava trees are hardy and adaptable, thriving in a variety of soil types, provided they are well-drained. They prefer full sun exposure and can tolerate periods of drought, although regular watering promotes better fruit production. The species is susceptible to frost and performs best in regions with warm climates. In some areas, guava has become invasive, particularly in tropical islands like the Gal√°pagos, where it poses a threat to native ecosystems.

Several cultivars have been developed to enhance specific fruit characteristics, such as size, flavor, and pulp color. For instance, in Brazil, cultivars like 'Paluma' and 'Pedro Sato' are popular for their red-fleshed fruits and high yield. In Taiwan, the 'Pearl' guava is favored for its crisp texture and sweet taste.

The wood of the guava tree is dense and durable, resistant to insect and fungal attacks, making it suitable for use in carpentry and as fuelwood. In Hawaii, guava wood is commonly used for smoking meats, imparting a distinct flavor to the food.

In summary, _Psidium guajava_ is a versatile plant with significant economic and cultural importance. Its edible fruits are cherished worldwide, and its medicinal properties have been recognized in various traditional healing practices. The tree's adaptability and resilience further contribute to its widespread cultivation and utilization.
