_Paubrasilia echinata_, commonly known as brazilwood or Pernambuco wood, is a tree species native to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is the sole species in the genus _Paubrasilia_. This tree holds significant historical, economic, and cultural importance, particularly in Brazil, where it is recognized as the national tree.

Brazilwood is a medium-sized, semi-deciduous tree that typically reaches heights of about 12 meters, though it can grow between 8 to 30 meters under favorable conditions. The trunk often exhibits a fluted appearance at the base and can have diameters exceeding 70 centimeters. The bark is brown, covered with lenticels, and tends to peel off in patches. Young specimens are notably thorny, with spines reaching up to 2 centimeters in length; however, as the tree matures, it becomes less spiny.

The leaves are alternately arranged and bipinnately compound, featuring six to twelve pairs of pinnae, each bearing 12 to 20 leaflets. These leaflets are sessile, oblong, and display a bright green color. The tree is known for its fragrant yellow flowers, which are zygomorphic and five-petaled, blooming primarily between August and September, coinciding with the onset of the rainy season in regions like São Paulo. The flowers are organized in upright racemose inflorescences and emit a mildly sweet citrus-like scent.

Following pollination, the tree produces brown, woody, flattened seed pods measuring 6 to 8 centimeters in length and 2 to 3 centimeters in width. These pods are obliquely ovoid to crescent-shaped and are covered with spines approximately 5 millimeters long. Upon reaching maturity, the pods dehisce, releasing one to three flat, brown seeds about 1 to 1.5 centimeters in diameter. The seeds possess a hard coat, often requiring up to two years to germinate.

Historically, _Paubrasilia echinata_ thrived in the coastal regions of Brazil, particularly within the Atlantic Forest biome, spanning states from Rio Grande do Norte to Rio de Janeiro, as well as Bahia, Espírito Santo, and Pernambuco. This biome is characterized by semi-evergreen seasonal forests on soils derived from sandy marine deposits. However, extensive exploitation and deforestation have led to the near extinction of natural populations, with only small groups of trees remaining in certain coastal plains.

The heartwood of brazilwood is dense and exhibits a vibrant orange-red hue, capable of achieving a high polish. Historically, this wood was a valuable source of a red dye known as brazilin, which oxidizes to brazilein, used extensively in the textile industry during the Middle Ages. The extraction of this dye was a significant economic activity during the early Portuguese colonization of Brazil, leading to the country's name being derived from this tree.

In modern times, the wood's exceptional density and resilience make it the preferred material for crafting bows for string instruments, such as violins, violas, and cellos. This specific use has led to the term "Pernambuco" being synonymous with high-quality bows in the music industry.

Due to overexploitation for its valuable dye and timber, coupled with habitat destruction from deforestation, _Paubrasilia echinata_ is currently classified as an endangered species. Conservation efforts are underway, including reforestation projects and the establishment of protected areas, to preserve the remaining populations and promote the species' recovery.

Beyond its economic value, brazilwood holds a profound place in Brazilian culture and identity. It is designated as the national tree of Brazil, symbolizing the country's rich natural heritage and historical roots. Efforts to conserve and restore this species are not only ecological but also cultural, aiming to preserve a living symbol of the nation's history and biodiversity.
