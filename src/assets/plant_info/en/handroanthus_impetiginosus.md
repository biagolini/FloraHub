_Handroanthus impetiginosus_, commonly known as the pink trumpet tree, is a deciduous tree belonging to the Bignoniaceae family, native to tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America. It can be found in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil. In Brazil, it is widely distributed in states like Acre, Pará, Maranhão, Piauí, Ceará, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraíba, Pernambuco, Bahia, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, Goiás, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo, as well as the Federal District.

The pink trumpet tree is a large tree, reaching heights between 8 and 12 meters in open areas and up to 30 meters in dense forests. It has a straight, cylindrical trunk measuring 40 to 80 centimeters in diameter, covered in thick, rough, brownish-gray bark. Its leaves are compound, typically composed of five elliptical to lanceolate leaflets, measuring between 5 and 9 centimeters in length and 4 to 6 centimeters in width, with serrated margins.

Flowering occurs at the end of winter and early spring, typically between July and September in the Southern Hemisphere. During this period, the tree sheds its leaves completely, enhancing the beauty of its striking flowers. The flowers are tubular, measuring around 4 centimeters in length, and range in color from pink to purple, though rare specimens may present white flowers. They are grouped in terminal panicles at the ends of the branches, making the pink trumpet tree highly ornamental and widely used in urban landscaping.

After the flowering period, the tree produces elongated, cylindrical seed pods that reach up to 30 centimeters in length. These pods contain numerous winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, facilitating the natural propagation of the species.

The wood of _Handroanthus impetiginosus_ is of excellent quality, ranging in color from yellowish-brown to dark brown. It is dense, heavy, and highly resistant to insect attacks and fungal growth. Due to these properties, it is widely used in construction, furniture-making, flooring, decks, and naval construction. However, sustainable harvesting is essential to ensure the conservation of this species and its natural habitat.

Beyond its timber use, the bark of the pink trumpet tree has been utilized in traditional medicine by indigenous communities and rural populations across Latin America. A tea made from the bark, known as "lapacho" or "taheebo," has been traditionally used to treat infections, fevers, and stomach ailments. Scientific studies have identified phenolic compounds in the bark, such as lapachol, with antibacterial and antifungal properties. However, its medicinal use should be approached with caution and under professional supervision due to possible toxicity at high doses.

Culturally, the pink trumpet tree holds great significance in South America. In Paraguay, it is considered the national tree and is known as "tajy hu." In Argentina and other Spanish-speaking countries, it is referred to as "lapacho rosado." In Brazil, it is popularly known as "ipê-roxo," though it also goes by other names like pau-d'arco-roxo, piúva, and piúna. Its striking presence during the flowering season and its economic and medicinal relevance make it one of the most distinguished trees in South American flora.

Ecologically, _Handroanthus impetiginosus_ plays a crucial role in its natural habitats. Its flowers provide nectar and pollen for various species of bees, birds, and other pollinators, contributing to local biodiversity conservation. Additionally, its seeds serve as food for different wildlife species, aiding in seed dispersal and natural forest regeneration.

In summary, _Handroanthus impetiginosus_ is a large tree recognized for its high-quality wood, ornamental flowers, and traditional medicinal applications. It contributes significantly to the biodiversity of tropical and subtropical forests in Latin America and holds considerable cultural and economic value in the regions where it is found.
