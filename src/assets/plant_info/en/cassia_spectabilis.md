_Cassia spectabilis_, also known as the golden shower tree, is a tree from the Fabaceae family, subfamily Caesalpinioideae. Native to South and Central America, it is frequently cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens, parks, and along public avenues due to its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months. Besides "golden shower tree," it is known by other common names such as "northeastern cassia," "macranta cassia," "fedegoso," "fedegoso do Rio," "macrantera," "hab√∫," "mwenu," "mhomba," or in English, "scented shower."

The tree is characterized by rapid growth, reaching heights between 2 to 15 meters, with a lush, rounded crown. The leaves are compound, arranged alternately, with 4 to 15 pairs of leaflets that can grow up to 7.5 cm long. These leaves exhibit a behavior known as nyctinasty, closing at night and opening at dawn.

Flowering occurs between March and April, producing bright yellow inflorescences measuring between 10 to 50 cm in length, each flower having a corolla of 3.5 to 4 cm in diameter and five unequal petals. The fruits are cylindrical pods, measuring between 16 to 30 cm in length and 0.9 to 1.2 cm in width, containing numerous flattened brown seeds.

_Cassia spectabilis_ adapts to a variety of soils, including clayey, sandy, silty, slightly alkaline, acidic, and even poor soils. It requires full sunlight and well-drained soil for optimal growth. It is a species resistant to pests and diseases, contributing to its popularity as an ornamental plant.

In addition to its ornamental use, _Cassia spectabilis_ possesses medicinal properties. It is used in the treatment of fungal infections, such as candidiasis, due to its significant antifungal activity. Studies also indicate that plant extracts exhibit anticonvulsant effects, being used in traditional medicine to treat epilepsy, constipation, insomnia, and anxiety.

However, it is important to note that in some regions, such as parts of Africa and southern India, _Cassia spectabilis_ has become an invasive species. Initially introduced to provide firewood and aid in the recovery of ecosystems degraded by deforestation and desertification, the plant ended up suppressing native species due to its rapid growth rate.

In summary, _Cassia spectabilis_ is a tree of great ornamental and medicinal value, appreciated for its bright yellow flowers and adaptability to diverse environments. However, it is essential to manage its spread responsibly to avoid negative impacts on local ecosystems.
