_Musa balbisiana_ is a species of wild banana native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as China, India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Myanmar. This species is one of the primary progenitors of modern cultivated bananas, having played a significant role in the development of many edible banana varieties.

The plant is a large, herbaceous perennial that can reach heights of up to six meters. It features robust pseudostems formed by tightly packed leaf sheaths. The leaves are large, oblong to elliptical, and can grow up to three meters in length and 60 centimeters in width. They are typically green with a waxy surface and are arranged spirally around the pseudostem.

_Musa balbisiana_ produces inflorescences that are pendulous, with bracts ranging in color from red to maroon. The flowers are tubular and white to yellowish-white, rich in nectar, and are arranged in clusters along the floral axis. Female flowers are located at the lower part of the inflorescence and develop into fruits, while male flowers are situated at the top.

The fruit is a linear or slightly curved berry, measuring 7 to 10 centimeters in length and about 2 to 3 centimeters in diameter. It has a thick, leathery peel that is green when immature and turns yellow upon ripening. The pulp is white, starchy, and contains numerous hard, black seeds, each about 4 to 6 millimeters in diameter. Due to the high seed content and minimal edible flesh, the fruits of wild _Musa balbisiana_ are generally considered inedible.

However, _Musa balbisiana_ has been instrumental in the development of many cultivated banana varieties. Through natural hybridization with _Musa acuminata_, it has contributed to the genetic makeup of numerous edible banana cultivars. These hybrids often exhibit desirable traits such as seedlessness, improved taste, and enhanced resilience to environmental stresses.

In addition to its role in banana cultivation, _Musa balbisiana_ has various practical uses. In regions where it grows, its large leaves are utilized for wrapping food, crafting containers, and as natural plates. The fibers extracted from the pseudostems are employed in making ropes, mats, and traditional textiles.

Culturally, _Musa balbisiana_ holds significance in certain traditions. For instance, in Thai folklore, it is believed that a spirit known as Nang Tani resides in this type of banana plant. This spirit is thought to appear as a young woman, and as a result, people often tie a piece of satin cloth around the trunk of the banana plant as a sign of respect.

Overall, _Musa balbisiana_ is a species that, despite producing fruits considered inedible due to their high seed content, has had a profound impact on agriculture through its contribution to the development of seedless, edible banana cultivars enjoyed worldwide today.
